Urgent:
    Fix paint bucket
    Re-organise the way the UI Bar is set out (Redesign, Small windows pop up for colour selection?)
    Move UI Class to separate cpp file and add as header

Definitely:
    Add icons for paint and pencil
    Brush Size
    More Colours (colour wheel?)
    retain recent colours in memory

Possibly:
    Resizable cellSize
    UI not effected by cellSize and windowSize (percent of windowSize?) (rayUI?)
    Eyedropper tool?
    Shapes tool? (line, rectangle, circle)
    Select tool
    Mirror tool (like in aeasprite)
    Copy, Cut & paste
    Undo/Redo
    Keyboard Shortcuts
    Save / load progress?
